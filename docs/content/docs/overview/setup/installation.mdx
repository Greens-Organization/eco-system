## Initialization

Run the `eco-system` init command:

```sh Terminal
bunx eco-system@latest init
```

You will be prompted for the project name and package manager preference (Bun is recommended and default).

```sh Terminal
$ bunx eco-system@latest init
â”Œ  Let's start a eco-system project!
â”‚
â—‡  What is your project named?
â”‚  my-app
â”‚
â—‡  Which package manager would you like to use?
â”‚  bun (recommended)
â”‚
â—‡  Project initialized successfully!
â”‚
â””  Please make sure you install the Mintlify CLI before starting the project.
```

This will create a new directory with your project name and clone the repo into it. It will run a setup script to install dependencies using Bun and copy `.env` files. You can read more about environment variables [here](/setup/env).

## Installation

Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```sh Terminal
cd my-app
bun install
```

Bun will install all dependencies significantly faster than traditional package managers while ensuring full compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem.

## Database

You will need to scaffold the database using the schema defined in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`:

```sh Terminal
bun migrate
```

For more details on the default Prisma configuration (using Neon), refer to the [Database Configuration Guide](/packages/db#default-configuration).

## CMS

You will need to setup the CMS. Follow the instructions [here](/features/cms), but the summary is:

1. Fork the [`basehub/eco-system`](https://basehub.com/basehub/eco-system?fork=1) template
2. Get your Read Token from the "Connect to Your App" page
3. Add the `BASEHUB_TOKEN` to your [Environment Variables](/setup/env)

## Development

Run the development server with:

```sh Terminal
bun dev
```

This will start all applications in the monorepo simultaneously. Bun's fast runtime ensures quick startup times and efficient hot reloading.

Open the localhost URLs with the relevant ports to see the apps:

- [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) â€” The main app
- [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) â€” The website
- [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/) â€” The API
- [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/) â€” Email preview server
- [http://localhost:3004/](http://localhost:3004/) â€” The docs

## Available Scripts

grn-eco-system comes with several useful scripts:

```sh Terminal
# Development

bun test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
```

## Performance Benefits

With Bun as the package manager and runtime, you'll experience:

- **âš¡ Faster installs**: Up to 25x faster package installation
- **ðŸš€ Quick startup**: Faster development server initialization  
- **ðŸ”„ Efficient HMR**: Improved hot module replacement
- **ðŸ’¾ Lower memory usage**: More efficient resource utilization

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Clear cache**: `bun pm cache rm`
2. **Reinstall dependencies**: `rm -rf node_modules bun.lock && bun install`
3. **Check Bun version**: `bun --version` (ensure you have 1.2.x)
4. **Verify environment**: Check that all required environment variables are set
