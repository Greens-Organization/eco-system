description: How to configure your development environment for eco-system.

## Operating System

eco-system is designed to work on macOS, Linux and Windows. While eco-system itself is platform-agnostic, the tooling and dependencies we use have different requirements.

We've tested and confirmed that eco-system works on the following combinations of operating systems, Bun versions and eco-system versions:

| Operating system | eco-system version | Bun version | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| macOS Sequoia 15.0.1 (24A348) | 1.0.0 | 1.2.x | Recommended for development |
| Ubuntu 24.04 Arm64 | 1.0.0 | 1.2.x | Full compatibility |
| Fedora, Release 41 | 1.0.0 | 1.2.x | Well tested |
| Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (26100.2033) | 1.0.0 | 1.2.x | Turborepo + Bun fully supported |

Bun has excellent cross-platform support and eliminates many of the compatibility issues traditionally seen with Node.js package managers.

## Package Manager

eco-system uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the primary package manager, providing significantly faster installation times and better development experience compared to traditional package managers.

### Bun Installation Quick Reference

**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
bun --version
```

## Development Tools

### Mintlify CLI

We use the Mintlify CLI to preview the [docs](/apps/docs) locally with `bun x`.

## Required Accounts

eco-system relies on various SaaS products for production-ready features. You will need to create accounts with the following services and set the API keys in your [environment variables](/setup/env):

### Authentication & Security
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com) - User authentication and management
- [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) - Application security and protection

### Analytics & Monitoring
- [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) - Web analytics
- [PostHog](https://posthog.com) - Product analytics and feature flags
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) - Error tracking and performance monitoring

### Infrastructure & Communication
- [BetterStack](https://betterstack.com) - Logging and uptime monitoring
- [Resend](https://resend.com) - Transactional email delivery

### Development Recommendations

For the best development experience with eco-system:

1. **Use the latest Bun version** - Regular updates include performance improvements
2. **Enable Bun shell** - Set `shell: "bun"` in your terminal for faster script execution
3. **Configure your IDE** - Ensure TypeScript support is enabled for the best experience
4. **Set up workspace aliases** - Use Bun workspaces for easier package management

Most services offer generous free tiers that are sufficient for development and testing purposes.
