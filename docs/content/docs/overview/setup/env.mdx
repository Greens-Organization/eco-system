description: How to handle environment variables in eco-system.
---

eco-system has a composable environment variable system that allows you to define and validate environment variables in a type-safe way for each package, then compose them together into a single environment variable file for the app.

## Overview

Type safety is provided by [@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://env.t3.gg/), which provides runtime validation and autocompletion for all environment variables. Each package can define its own environment variables in a `chaves.ts` file, which exports a `chaves` object that contains all validated environment variables, separated into `server` and `client` variables.

These chaves are then composed together into a single environment variable file for the app, located in an `env.ts` file in the root of the app.

Bun natively supports `.env` files and automatically loads them without additional configuration, providing excellent performance for environment variable processing.

## Environment variable files

As part of the initial setup script, each `.env.example` file is copied to a real environment variable file in each Next.js application and some packages. From here, you can fill in the variables yourself.

Here are the files you will need to fill in:

- `apps/app/.env.local` - The app's environment variables
- `apps/web/.env.local` - The web app's environment variables  
- `apps/api/.env.local` - The API app's environment variables
- `packages/db/.env` - The database package's environment variables
- `packages/cms/.env.local` - The CMS package's environment variables
- `packages/i18n/.env.local` - The internationalization package's environment variables

<Info>
  We're aiming to remove the need for the package environment variable files, so if you have any suggestions for how to do this, please let us know.

## Bun Environment Loading

Bun provides enhanced environment variable handling:

- **Automatic loading**: Bun automatically loads `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc.
- **Priority order**: `.env.local` > `.env.development` > `.env`
- **Fast processing**: Environment variables are loaded with zero overhead
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across all operating systems

You can also use Bun's built-in environment utilities:

```bash
# Check loaded environment variables
bun run --print process.env.NODE_ENV

# Load specific env file
bun --env-file=.env.production run dev
```

## Validation rules

Each package's `chaves.ts` file contains the validation rules for each environment variable. These are used to validate the environment variables in the `.env.local` files. You can inspect these files to see the validation rules for each variable.

<Tip>
You should be as specific as possible with your validation. For example, if you know that a vendor secret starts with `sec_`, you should validate it as `z.string().min(1).startsWith('sec_')`. This will not only make your intent clearer to anyone reading your code, but will also help prevent errors at runtime.
</Tip>

## Integration environment variables

Some environment variables will be added by integrations and other tooling. For example, environment variables prefixed with `SENTRY_` are automatically added to a Vercel project when you add the Sentry integration from the Vercel Marketplace. Additionally, `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` is a very handy environment variable that refers to the "production" URL to which this project is deployed on Vercel.

Bun also exposes some useful built-in environment variables:
- `BUN_ENV` - Current Bun environment
- `BUN_INSTALL` - Bun installation directory
- `BUN_VERSION` - Current Bun version

## Adding an environment variable

To add a new environment variable, you need to do two things:

1. Add the variable to each of the `.env.local` files across the project
2. Add the variable to the `server` or `client` object in the relevant package's `chaves.ts` file

### Example: Adding a new API key

1. **Add to environment files:**
```bash
# apps/app/.env.local
NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# apps/web/.env.local  
NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. **Add to validation schema:**
```typescript
// packages/new-service/chaves.ts
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-nextjs';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const chaves = createEnv({
  server: {
    NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY: z.string().min(1).startsWith('nsk_'),
  },
  client: {},
  runtimeEnv: {
    NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY: process.env.NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

## Environment variable best practices

- **Use descriptive names**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` instead of `SK`
- **Group by service**: Prefix related variables (`STRIPE_`, `SENTRY_`, etc.)
- **Validate strictly**: Use specific validation rules for each variable
- **Document requirements**: Add comments explaining where to get values
- **Never commit secrets**: Always use `.env.local` for sensitive data
- **Use different values per environment**: Development, staging, and production should have separate values

## Troubleshooting

**Environment variables not loading:**
```bash
# Check if Bun can see your variables
bun run --print process.env

# Verify .env file syntax
bun run --env-file=.env.local --print process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE
```

**Validation errors:**
- Check that all required variables are set in your `.env.local` files
- Verify that variable values match the validation schema in `chaves.ts`
- Ensure there are no typos in variable names

**Performance tips:**
- Bun loads environment variables faster than Node.js
- Group related environment validations in the same package
- Use Bun's native environment loading instead of third-party libraries when possible
