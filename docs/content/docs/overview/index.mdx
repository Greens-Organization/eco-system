description: What is eco-system and how do I get started?
---

eco-system is a production-grade [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps, powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager. It is designed to be a comprehensive starting point for new apps, providing a solid, opinionated foundation with a minimal amount of configuration.

**Inspired by [next-forge](https://nextjs.org/)** - All credits go to the original creators for their excellent foundation and vision. This project builds upon their outstanding work while adapting it for the Bun ecosystem.
