## Why not use the original next-forge?

eco-system maintains all the quality and insights of next-forge, but adds the performance benefits of Bun. If you value development speed and a more modern experience, this is a natural evolution while maintaining the same solid foundation.

## Why use Bun instead of npm/pnpm/yarn?

Bun offers significantly better performance when installing packages (up to 25x faster), and is a modern JavaScript runtime that natively supports TypeScript. The development experience is smoother with faster hot reloads and lower memory usage, making the workflow much more efficient.

## Are there any limitations to using Bun?

While Bun is highly compatible with the Node.js ecosystem, some older or specific dependencies may have compatibility issues. However, for most modern Next.js use cases, Bun works perfectly and offers better performance.
